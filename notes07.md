# Domain Modeling
I think I understand it better actually. I need to revise all of my construct function in the morning with craig and see how I can do it. Thank you domain modeling article. Domain modeling is the process of creating a model for a specific problem. A domain model that is made well can verify and validate your understanding of the problem. 

# tables
a table is a grid format for displaying information. Tables have headings and everything just like a body. it is just th rather than h1. you can make the tables long or expand them. 

# objects
108 and 109 have full explanations of objects. Review these tomorrow morning. This entire section is what I have been confused on. Honestly what this taught me is that I really need to do the readings before I do the coding.
