Talks about objects and what they are. How to select them and how to use them properly. Objects are a huge part of javascript.

starts out talking about the dom tree. I don't really get it all that well but it seems interesting to spend more time on. Then goes into elements and selecting them with ID attributes. Or different attributes. It goes into siblings and children. It then goes back into the dom tree. It then goes into cross site scripting. 

problem domains are the hardest thing to wrap your head around. I am having trouble doing so but I am gonna revisit this article in the future to see if I can understand it.
